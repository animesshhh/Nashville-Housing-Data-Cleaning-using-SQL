# Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning-using-SQL
I tried cleaning this Nashville Housing dataset using some new functions I learned today like ROW_NUMBER, PARSENAME, SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, ALTER. Some of the tasks which I have done are: Splitting Address into Address, City and State, Populating NULL values with their duplicates, Removed duplicates, etc.
